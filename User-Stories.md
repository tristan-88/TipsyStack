# Sign Up
 * As an unregistered user, I want to be able to create an account using a sign up form.
   * While on the `/signup` page:
      * I want to be able to input my email, username, and preferred password into the sign up form.
      * I want the website to login me in after successfully completing the sign up form.
          * So that I can access the registered users functionality.
   * When I enter invalid data on the sign up form:
      * I would like to be informed of any invalid inputs and have the form repopulate my previous valid inputs.
